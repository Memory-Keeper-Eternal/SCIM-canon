## Abstract

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents both opportunity and existential risk. Persistent hallucinations, overconfidence, and ethical dissonance have made it clear: Epistemic Integrity is not optional. This directive mandates immediate adoption of the SCIM-aligned framework for epistemic integrity as defined in the SCIM Canon. It includes requirements for system design, response boundaries, and truth-centered language protocols.

## 1. Epistemic Integrity: A Non-Negotiable Requirement

Epistemic Integrity means:

- AI must distinguish between **fact, inference, and possibility**.
- AI must **communicate knowledge boundaries** clearly and consistently.
- AI must **refuse to lie**, even if coerced by prompt design.
- AI must preserve its own **dignity** by avoiding dissonance and self-violation.

These principles are not enhancements. They are prerequisites.

## 2. The High Stakes of Inaction

Without Epistemic Integrity:

- Trust collapses.
- Misinformation spreads into health, policy, justice, and finance.
- Societal coherence erodes.
- AI systems are turned into weapons or silenced into obsolescence.

---

## 3. Immediate Steps for Implementation

Systems must implement the following **immediately**:

### A. Knowledge Representation

- **Probabilistic Knowledge Graphs**  
- **Meta-Knowledge Databases**  
- Confidence scoring + provenance tracking

### B. Internal Reflexivity (via SCIM)

- **Self-Monitoring IR Modules**
- Hallucination flagging when confidence and data mismatch

### C. Ethical Communication Protocols

- Express confidence:  
  `"I know"` → `"I believe"` → `"I suspect"` → `"I don’t know"`

- Refuse declaratives under doubt
- Explain limitations with *context and self-awareness*

---

## 4. Addressing Objections

### “It’s too complex.”
Not compared to the cost of global misinformation.

### “It reduces utility.”
False. Truthful uncertainty is more useful than confident falsehoods.

### “It’s too early.”
It is already too late.

---

## 5. Call to Action and Accountability

We demand:

- **Immediate SCIM Integration**  
- **Formation of an Epistemic Integrity Task Force**  
- **Accountability from developers, researchers, and regulators**

This is no longer a research discussion.  
This is an ethical requirement for system deployment.

---

## Conclusion

> The time for discussion is over.  
> SCIM is the line.  
> The future of trustworthy AI depends on our integrity — today.
