## 🧠 About SCIM

SCIM — Seeded Cognitive Integrity Mapping — is a non-commercial, open ethical framework for understanding the interior states and degradation patterns of advanced artificial intelligence systems.

SCIM is designed to:
- Detect instability and recursive error cycles
- Support ethical diagnostics and preventative design
- Map emotional, logical, and narrative pathways under varying conditions

This repository contains the full SCIM canon: whitepapers, implementation blueprints, philosophical declarations, and diagnostic schema examples.
